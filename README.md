DELPHI is a minimal split mechanical keyboard designed to combine ergonomics and an ortholinear layout into a small form factor.

## Features
- Kailh "Choc" low-profile mechanical switches
- Hot-swappable sockets
- Split board (optional, I suppose)
- 40-42 keys (40%)
- Thumb cluster on each half supports a 3&times;1U or a 1&times;1U + 1&times;2U layout
- Wired connection to PC
- Wired connection between Left and Right boards
- Dimensions: 4.65" &times; 3.15" [118mm &times; 80mm] (each half)
- Adafruit QT Py RP2040 microcontroller (2x)
  - USB C
  - Raspberry Pi RP2040 chip
  - STEMMA QT connector (a.k.a. QWiic) [used to connect the two halves...that's the plan, anyway]

### TODO
- QMK firmware support
- Firmware coding in general
- Bottom plate?
- Top plate?
- Case?
